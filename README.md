# UsefulPythonScript
To collect some useful python script that I use in my past work

Usually just drag it into the folder that you'd like to run it, and open the terminal and run:

$ python3 xxx.py -a 123 -b 321


And it will work just fine. Also check the environment requirement yourself, which I don't really know what will went wrong on other computers~
