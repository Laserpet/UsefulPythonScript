# UsefulPythonScript
To collect some useful python script that I use in my past work

Usually just drag it into the folder that you'd like to run it, and open the terminal and run:

$ python3 xxx.py -a 123 -b 321


And it will work just fine. Also check the environment requirement yourself, which I don't really know what will went wrong on other computers~


# RenamePictures.py
    Rename all jpg jpeg png webp files in folders
    Notice that all except png will be converted into jpg.
    Once done, it could not be undone, use with care.


# BatchTest.py
    Specificly used in my TensorRT project, to test the engine file that was converted in batch and output the info into json file.
